## Changelog 12-31

-   Added ability for router to initially accept new url

### Needs:

-   Load in the JS along with the html and figure out how that connection will work
    -   start this by allowing the console log to load in on page load, then attach functions to that HTML
    -   May be solvable through event listeners
