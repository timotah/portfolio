 * 2. need to ensure that the path is updated when clicking on a button
 * 3. need to ensure that the path is updated when going backward
 * 4. Need to investigate on how to prevent paths from being overloaded
 * 5. Keep resume in S3 to avoid it being loaded in with static every time? - finished site problem
