# Feature Specification: Portfolio First Pass Development

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-first-pass`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop Tim Radtke's portfolio, this is a portfolio that must showcase technical ability with currently only vanilla js, html, css. You can use express.js for the backend server. On first page load, which should only take one round trip since it is under 14kb total, A user should see my name, relevant links such as github and linkedin, a section where in the future I can update my relevant projects, a "Current Learning" portion, an About Me section, and a Contact Me section. I would like this to be a relatively simple portfolio project but something that features some cool features of modern native web development, I want to minimize on web animations right now to allow for minimized lag time. In the about me section I want a left side vertical sidebar for navigation, this should be a multi-page application that minimizes the javascript needed on pageload for people with poor connections, but it should look modern as well. Use minimal colors on first pass. The resume.pdf explains my current credentials."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A potential employer or professional contact visits Tim Radtke's portfolio to evaluate his technical skills and professional background. They expect to quickly find his key information, professional links, current projects, learning activities, and contact details in a fast-loading, accessible format that demonstrates modern web development capabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the portfolio homepage, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see Tim's name, GitHub/LinkedIn links, projects section, current learning section, about me section, and contact section within 2 seconds on a 3G connection
2. **Given** a user wants to learn more about Tim, **When** they navigate to the About Me section, **Then** they see a left sidebar navigation and detailed professional information
3. **Given** a user wants to contact Tim, **When** they access the Contact section, **Then** they find multiple ways to reach him
4. **Given** a user is on a slow connection, **When** they navigate between sections, **Then** the site remains responsive with minimal JavaScript execution
5. **Given** a user uses assistive technology, **When** they browse the portfolio, **Then** all content is accessible via screen readers and keyboard navigation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled in the browser?
- How does the site perform on mobile devices with limited bandwidth?
- What happens when the projects section is empty (future updates)?
- How does the sidebar navigation behave on small screens?
