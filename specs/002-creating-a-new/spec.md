# Feature Specification: Client-Server Routing for Portfolio

**Feature Branch**: `002-creating-a-new`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "creating a new feature to ensure this application first attempts to use javascript client side routing for the purpose of the best user experience and minimal reloads, if javascript is turned off we want to have server routing on the backend for static html pages, which is already implemented here. This is to achieve the best user experience in routing for my portfolio"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A visitor to Tim Radtke's portfolio navigates between sections (Home, Projects, About Me, Current Learning, Contact) and expects fast, seamless transitions without full page reloads. If their browser has JavaScript disabled, navigation should still work reliably via server-side routing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is browsing the portfolio with JavaScript enabled, **When** they click a navigation link, **Then** the content updates instantly without a full page reload and the URL reflects the new section.
2. **Given** a user is browsing with JavaScript disabled, **When** they click a navigation link, **Then** the browser loads the correct static HTML page from the server.
3. **Given** a user uses browser navigation (back/forward), **When** they interact with the portfolio, **Then** the correct section is displayed and the experience remains consistent.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user navigates to an unknown route?
- How does the system behave if a fetch for a section fails?
- What happens if the main content area is missing or malformed?
- How does the system handle accessibility for keyboard and screen reader users?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide seamless navigation between main sections (Home, Projects, About Me, Current Learning, Contact) using client-side JavaScript when available, with all templates bundled via Vite for instant navigation.
- **FR-002**: System MUST update the browser URL and history state to reflect the current section during client-side navigation.
- **FR-003**: System MUST fallback to server-side routing for static HTML pages if JavaScript is disabled or unavailable.
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure all navigation links are accessible and functional for keyboard and screen reader users.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle browser back/forward navigation correctly, updating content and URL as expected.
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a user-friendly error page or message for unknown routes or failed content loads.
- **FR-007**: System MUST minimize JavaScript execution and asset size to maintain fast load times and responsiveness, leveraging Vite's bundling and code splitting if needed.
- **FR-008**: System MUST not degrade the user experience for users with slow connections or limited devices.

### Key Entities
- **Navigation Section**: Represents each main area of the portfolio (Home, Projects, About Me, Current Learning, Contact), identified by a unique route and associated content. Content is bundled as HTML templates via Vite and swapped in by the client-side router.
- **User**: Any visitor to the portfolio, regardless of device or browser capabilities.
