# Feature Specification: Routing Finalization

**Feature Branch**: `003-routing-finalization`  
**Created**: October 11, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we are creating a new branch for developing a couple features in my portfolio, these features are aimed at completing the routing configuration of having spa routing with a server side fallback, and implementing a component cache for the spa routing"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves completing SPA routing with server-side fallback and component cache
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: End users, search engines
   ‚Üí Actions: Navigate between pages, direct URL access, component lifecycle management
   ‚Üí Data: Route configurations, cached component instances
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must work with and without JavaScript
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Component cache behavior patterns need clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for SPA navigation and fallback scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on routing behavior and performance
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Router, Component Cache, Route Configuration entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focuses on user needs, avoids implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users should be able to navigate seamlessly through the portfolio website, whether they have JavaScript enabled or disabled. The site should provide fast, responsive navigation for modern browsers while maintaining full functionality as a fallback for users with JavaScript disabled or in environments where JavaScript fails to load.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits any page URL directly, **When** they access the site, **Then** they receive a complete, functional HTML page regardless of JavaScript availability
2. **Given** a user has JavaScript enabled, **When** they click navigation links, **Then** page content updates instantly without full page reloads
3. **Given** a user navigates between multiple pages in SPA mode, **When** they return to a previously visited page, **Then** the page loads quickly using cached components
4. **Given** a user disables JavaScript after loading the site, **When** they click navigation links, **Then** they still receive functional pages via server-side routing
5. **Given** a user refreshes the page on any route, **When** the page reloads, **Then** they receive the correct content for that specific route

### Edge Cases
- What happens when JavaScript fails to load or crashes during navigation?
- How does the system handle memory management when users navigate extensively?
- What occurs when a user attempts to access a non-existent route?
- How does the system behave when component initialization fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST serve complete, functional HTML pages when any route is accessed directly via URL
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable client-side navigation that updates page content without full page reloads when JavaScript is available
- **FR-003**: System MUST cache component instances to improve navigation performance for repeat visits
- **FR-004**: System MUST properly manage component lifecycle with activate, deactivate, and destroy capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain clean memory management by removing unused event listeners and references during navigation
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle route mismatches by serving appropriate 404 content
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure cached components can be reactivated with proper event listener restoration
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide fallback navigation that works without JavaScript enabled

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Router**: Manages navigation between routes, handles both client-side and server-side routing coordination
- **Component Cache**: Stores and manages reusable component instances, handles activation/deactivation states
- **Route Configuration**: Defines available routes, maps URLs to components and HTML templates
- **Component Lifecycle Manager**: Handles creation, caching, activation, deactivation, and destruction of page components
